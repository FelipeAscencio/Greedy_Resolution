# Greedy Algorithms in the Fire Nation.

---

## Introduction

In this project we sought to solve a problem that is presented to us in a "Greedy" way.

For this work, an exhaustive report was made, going through all the important points of the process until the "optimal" solution was obtained.

All project analysis is located in the "Report" folder.

# Explanation of each folder

First of all, this was a project for the university, so the code is written in spanish.

With this clarified, we move on to the report.

## Report

In this folder you will find the project report in "pdf" format.

## ReadyToRun

In this folder are the 3 ".py" that were made for the project and all the test files used.

This folder is used to facilitate the execution of the 3 programs when testing their operation.

## Programs

In this folder are the 3 ".py" made for the project.

## Tests

In this folder are all the tests used for the project, both those provided by the chair and their own.

# Explanation of execution

To execute the programs and check their operation, you must follow the following steps:
- Download the "ReadyToExecute" folder in its entirety.
- Enter from the "Linux" console (Or the operating system of preference with its own commands) to the downloaded directory.
- Execute the command "python3 tp1.py", "python3 graphics.py" or "python3 examplenames.py" depending on the program you want to use.

## Program "tp1.py"

This program is the one requested by the statement, it contains the "Greedy Algorithm" that solves the problem posed optimally.

Once the "python3 tp1.py" command has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file that you want to use for the sum to be performed. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10.txt", you should only enter it through the "10" terminal.

After entering the file name, the program will run to solve the sum and print the order followed by the battles.

## Program "graficos.py"

This program allows us to create graphics with the "Matplotlib" tool.

Once the command "python3 graphics.py" has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file that you want to use for the sum to be performed. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10.txt", you should only enter it through the "10" terminal.

After entering the name of the file, the program will print on the screen the graph obtained that represents the "Computational Complexity" of said execution (where the trend towards the theoretically analyzed computational complexity of "n.log(n)" is seen). .

When you close the graphic printed on the screen, the program will terminate.

## Program "ejemplonombres.py"

This program was created for several reasons:
- First: It allows you to compare various ways of performing the summation, making it easier for the user to see some "non-optimal" examples of "Greedy" algorithms that perform the requested calculation.
- Second: It makes it easier to understand how the algorithm that was found to be "optimal" for resolving the sum carries out the order of the battles, since this program executes a specific "txt" that not only assigns values ​​to the cities to attack, but also Also proper names making it more enjoyable to follow the order.

Clarification: This last program is only provided as a way to expand the research and development carried out for the correct resolution of practical work.
